Online banking is another popular internet use, as many institutions offer most in-person features online and some exclusive ones too. Set up overdraft protection alerts so you’re never at risk of overspending, sign up for paperless billing and check statements online.

Many of the utility and home service providers you already know and use offer [online bill payment](https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/o/online-bill-payment/) systems for convenient ways to pay your monthly bills at home. Many of these systems even have automatic bill payment features, so you can set a day each month for automatic withdrawals.

Looking for a way to manage multiple household bills? Combine bill pay and online banking by authorizing your bank to send recurring payments for you to all of your service providers. Even if your provider doesn’t have their own bill pay system, banks can often send payments on your behalf electro
